Some languages are intrinsically ambiguous, i.e., every CFG for the
following language is ambiguous, e.g.,
{ a^n b^n c^m : n >= 0, m >= 0 } U { a^n b^m c^m : n >= 0, m >= 0 }

# ~/LEyapp/examples/debuggingtut$ eyapp -vTC AmbiguousLanguage1.eyp 
# 1 shift/reduce conflict and 1 reduce/reduce conflict
# ~/LEyapp/examples/debuggingtut$ eyapp -P ab.eyp 
# ~/LEyapp/examples/debuggingtut$ ./AmbiguousLanguage1.pm -t -i -m 1 -c 'abbcc'
# ~/LEyapp/examples/debuggingtut$ ./AmbiguousLanguage1.pm -t -i -m 1 -c 'aabbc'
