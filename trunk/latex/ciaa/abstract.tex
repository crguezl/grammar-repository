Yacc-like LR parser generators provide ways to statically solve
shift-reduce mechanisms based on token precedence. No
mechanisms are provided for the resolution of difficult reduce-reduce
and shift-reduce conflicts. To solve such kind of conflicts the language
designer has to modify the grammar.  The usual approach
to cope with these limitations has been to extend
LR parsers with the capacity to branch at any multivalued
table entry. 
The strategy presented in this paper takes an entirely different path:
It extends
yacc conflict resolution sub-language with new dynamic
conflict resolution constructs specifying which production 
must be chosen in terms of the results of some nested parsing.
The LR parsing table is then modified at parsing time using the
information provided by the nested parser.
Through this simple modification LALR parsers
are able to parse ambiguous gramars and recognize inherently ambiguous
languages.
