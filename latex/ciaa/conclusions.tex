%FUTURE WORK/OPEN PROBLEM: using the high level syntax, not any CFL can be 
%parsed using high level syntax PPCR?

The strategy presented in this paper
extends the classic yacc precedence mechanisms
with new dynamic conflict resolution constructs.
These new instruments provide ways to resolve conflicts
that can not be solved using static precedences.
providing a
finer control over the conflict resolution process
than other alternatives like GLR and backtracking LR.
The cost of implementing these extensions in existing yacc-like 
parsers is minimal.The lost of efficiency is also negligible.
